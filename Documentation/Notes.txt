1. promise takes one param only. if you need to pass multiple values, pass it as an object ex. function-promise.js
2.setTimeout for delay
3.The value that will be pass determines on the value you gave on promise params.
4.then for succesful and catch for errors.
5.U can use a method to perform a specific task if successful and error
6.The keyword async before a function makes the function return a promise:
7.The await keyword can only be used inside an async function.
8.The await keyword makes the function pause the execution and wait for a resolved promise before it continues:
9. async await and promise aint accepting multpile values only single so wrap it  on obj or array depends on your need
10.callback is a function passed to another method or function.
11. fs for filesystem, path for filepath, readline for terminal interactivity
12. practice to return the resolve and reject values in promises, funtcion that have promises must return the promise
13. resolve, reject are promises methods so therefore a function that has a promise nust return a promise object and inside of promise object must return value
14. for of for values, for in for keys. but not adviceable to use for of in keys
15. if you return a promise, it cant print itself so use console.log
